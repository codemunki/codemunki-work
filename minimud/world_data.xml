			<description>You appear in a dark, smelly tavern.  You can't pick out any specific conversation amongst the cacophony, but you're sure it's there.  The exit to the street is to the west.  What looks like a door to a storeroom is to the north.</description>

			<description>You turn on to Main Street.  There isn't much traffic this time of day.  To the east is a loud, smelly tavern.</description>

			<description>You quietly sneak into the storeroom.  It is lined with the skulls of sacrificed animals.  There is a pentagam painted on the floor in blood.  You wonder what exactly is in the meat pie.  To the south is the door back into the main Tavern.</description>
