		<description>You appear in a dark, smelly tavern.  You can't pick out any specific conversation amongst the cacophony, but you're sure it's there.  The exit to the street is to the west.  There is a rusty lantern on the table in front of you.  What looks like a door to a storeroom is to the north.</description>
